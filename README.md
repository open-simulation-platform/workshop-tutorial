# workshop-tutorial
In this tutorial, we will build up a simple model of a vessel and run a few simulations where we make it navigate along a given trajectory using its DP system.

Follow the instructions as described in the PDFs: [Prerequisities](https://github.com/open-simulation-platform/workshop-tutorial/blob/main/Prerequisities%20-%20please%20prepare%20BEFORE%20the%20workshop.pdf) and [osp-workshop-tutorial](https://github.com/open-simulation-platform/workshop-tutorial/blob/main/osp-workshop-tutorial.pdf)

Goal: Get a hands-on experience with OSP using a set of problems and models prepared by the OSP team.
